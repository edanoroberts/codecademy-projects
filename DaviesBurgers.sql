1
What are the column names?

SELECT *
FROM orders
LIMIT 10;

2 
How recent is this data?

2017-05-03

3
Instead of selecting all the columns using *, 
write a query that selects only the special_instructions column.

Limit the result to 20 rows.

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
LIMIT 20;

4 
Can you edit the query so that we are only 
returning the special instructions that are not empty?

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL;

5
Let’s go even further and sort the instructions 
in alphabetical order (A-Z).

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY special_instructions ASC;

6
Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘sauce’.

Are there any funny or interesting ones? 

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
  AND special_instructions LIKE '%sauce%'
ORDER BY special_instructions ASC;

7
Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘door’.
Any funny or interesting ones?

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
  AND special_instructions LIKE '%door%'
ORDER BY special_instructions ASC;

8
Let’s search for special instructions that have the word ‘box’.
Any funny or interesting ones?

SELECT special_instructions
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions IS NOT NULL
  AND special_instructions LIKE '%box%'
ORDER BY special_instructions ASC;

9
Instead of just returning the special instructions, also return their order ids.

For more readability:
Rename id as ‘#’
Rename special_instructions as ‘Notes’

SELECT id AS '#',
  special_instructions AS 'Notes'
FROM orders;

Challenge
They have asked you to query the customer who made the phrase. 
Return the item_name restaurant_id, and user_id for the person created the phrase.
*/
SELECT item_name, restaurant_id, user_id
FROM orders
WHERE special_instructions LIKE '%box%';
