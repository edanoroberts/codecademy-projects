 1.
Let’s start by checking out the whole transactions table:

SELECT *
FROM transactions;

2.
The money_in column records the amount (in USD) the user bought.

What is the total money_in in the table?

SELECT SUM(money_in)
FROM transactions;
-- 17173.0

3.
The money_out column records the amount (in USD) the user sold.

What is the total money_out in the table?

SELECT SUM(money_out)
FROM transactions;
-- 33417.0

4.
It was reported that Bitcoin dominates Fiddy Cent’s exchange. Let’s see if it is true within these dates by answering two questions:

How many money_in transactions are in this table?
How many money_in transactions are in this table where ‘BIT’ is the currency?

SELECT COUNT(money_in)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'BIT';
-- 43 transactions, 21 'BIT' transactions

5.
What was the largest transaction in this whole table?

Was it money_in or money_out?

SELECT MAX(money_in)
FROM transactions;
-- 6000

SELECT MAX(money_out)
FROM transactions;
-- 15047.0
-- money_out is higher

6.
What is the average money_in in the table for the currency Ethereum (‘ETH’)?

SELECT ROUND(AVG(money_in), 2)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'ETH';
-- 131.89

7.
Let’s build a ledger for the different dates.

Select date, average money_in, and average money_out from the table.

And group everything by date.

SELECT date, AVG(money_in), AVG(money_out)
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;

8.
To make the previous query easier to read, round the averages to 2 decimal places.

Give the column aliases using AS for readability.
*/
SELECT date, 
  ROUND(AVG(money_in), 2) AS 'Average Money In', 
  ROUND(AVG(money_out), 2) AS 'Average Money Out'
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;
